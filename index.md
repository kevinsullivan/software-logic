## Software Logic (UVa CS 4501 and 6501)

* Course Numbers: CS 4501-001 (16039); CS 6501-008 (20760)
* Instructor: Kevin Sullivan
* Place: Web-Based Course (Synchronous)
* Time: TuTh 11:00AM - 12:15PM

**Overview.** This combined advanced undergraduate and graduate course will introduce students to basic logics and their uses for specification and analysis of software systems, including basic programming languages. Such tools have proven to be valuable in the production of high assurance software-driven systems, ranging from compilers that generate provably correct code, to microprocessors that provably have critical correctness properties, to drones that are provably immune to important classes of security attacks. 

**Prerequisites.** The 4501 section of this course is open to advanced undergraduates who have take at least one course in theoretical computer science (algorithms, theory of computing, or CS 2102 as taught by Sullivan with instructor permission). 

**Learning Objectives.** Students who take this course will learn about functional programming, constructive logic, interactive proof construction;   applications of these ideas to programming language specification; specification and verification of programs written in imperative language; and  formalization of mathematics. The course uses the Lean Prover as an interactive proof assistant and programming system.
